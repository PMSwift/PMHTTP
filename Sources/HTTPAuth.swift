    /// Returns the headers that should be added to the given request.
    ///
    /// This is most commonly used to set the `"Authorization"` header.
    ///
    /// - Note: This method may be called from any thread.
    ///
    /// - Note: `HTTPAuth` is not allowed to set `"Content-Type"`, `"Content-Length"`, or
    ///   `"Accept"`, and any attempt to do so will be ignored.
    ///
    /// - Parameter request: The `URLRequest` that the headers should be added to.
    @objc(headersForRequest:)
    func headers(for request: URLRequest) -> [String: String]
    
    /// Returns an opaque token that is associated with the request.
    ///
    /// If implemented, this method is called immediately after` headers(for:)`.
    ///
    /// - Note: This method is not guaranteed to be called every time `headers(for:)` is. Notably,
    ///   when `preparedURLRequest` is accessed, `headers(for:)` will be invoked but not
    ///   `opaqueToken(for:)`.
    ///
    /// This token can be used to uniquely identify the authorization information used for the
    /// request. Then in `handleUnauthorized(_:for:token:completion:)` you can use this token to
    /// determine if you've already refreshed your stored authorization information or if you need
    /// to do extra work (such as fetching a new OAuth2 token) before you can retry the request.

    /// Invoked when a 401 Unauthorized response is received.
    ///
    /// This method is only called once per request. If this method is invoked and requests a retry,
    /// and the subsequent retry fails due to 401 Unauthorized, this is considered a permanent
    /// failure.
    ///
    /// - Note: This method will be called on an arbitrary background thread.
    ///
    /// - Note: Special care must be taken when implementing this method. Multiple tasks may be
    ///   created with the same authorization headers in parallel and may all fail even after you've
    ///   refreshed your authorization information (e.g. with OAuth2). You can use
    ///   `opaqueToken(for:)` in order to keep track of whether a given request was created with old
    ///   authorization information or whether you need to refresh your authorization information.
    ///
    /// - Important: The completion block **MUST** be called once and only once. Failing to call the
    ///   completion block will leave the task stuck in the processing state forever. Calling the
    ///   completion block multiple times may cause bad behavior.
    ///
    /// - Note: When the completion block is invoked, if the task is not retried, the task's own
    ///   completion block may run synchronously on the current queue.
    ///
    /// - Parameter response: The `HTTPURLResponse` that was received.
    /// - Parameter body: The body that was received.
    /// - Parameter task: The `HTTPManagerTask` that received the response.
    /// - Parameter token: The opaque token returned from `opaqueToken(for:)`, otherwise `nil`.
    /// - Parameter completion: A completion block that must be called when the `HTTPAuth` object
    ///   has finished handling the response. This block may be called synchronously, or it may be called from any thread.
